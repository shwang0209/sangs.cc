          <h2>Stamford Bridge 3D Animation</h2>
          <p>This video is my first venture into Cinema4D and the world of 3D in general.<br><br>The video tells a story from Timo Werner’s perspective, a newly recruited soccer player from Germany. The camera alternates between POV shots and Television views, showing the game in which Timo Werner scored his first goal for his new team, Chelsea FC. The decision to leave most of the area largely untextured was a conscious choice to highlight the mental focus of the player.<br><br>This project initially started in AfterEffects, but ultimately the decision to extensively use 3D objects led to the shift to Cinema 4D. This program allowed new layers of dynamism to be added to the project, as physics and character animations were now possible. This project was largely a learning experience as I got used to the program but I was still able to create something rather elaborate, especially with the post-compositing in AfterEffects. Most of the textures used in Cinema 4D, as well as the motion graphics present, were created using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

          <h2>American Friends of Jamaica</h2>
          <h3>Honoree/Entertainer Intros</h3>
          <p>In 2019, I stumbled upon the great opportunity of creating something great. Whilst I was working as a social media intern at the nonprofit organization American Friends of Jamaica, I was able to showcase my graphic design skills to the executive director and was effectively made a graphic design intern. The most exciting project I undertook that summer was designing for the 2019 Hummingbird Gala.<br><br>The gala held greater meaning than the years prior, as the one and only World Record holder and Olympic Gold Medalist Usain Bolt would be honored at the event. To announce the honorees and the entertainers for 2019’s gala, I created a series of introductions to be posted on The AFJ’s social media platforms.<br><br>The identity of the 2019 Hummingbird Gala was an elegant mix of black and gold; however, I wanted these introduction cards to stand out from the rest of the promotion materials that were created. I chose to incorporate high contrasting accents to ensure they caught the audiences’ eyes and directed the attention to Usain Bolt, which had the highest chance to catch someone’s attention.<br><br>I took a more traditional approach to the entertainer introduction cards, sticking with the gala’s identity of black and gold. Some adjustments were made to the source photos and backgrounds to keep a uniform feel across the two posts.</p>
          <h3>Hummingbird 2019 Identity</h3>
          <p>I am personally excited to talk about the social media banner as Usain Bolt personally liked it. The banner highlights the presence of Usain Bolt using a silhouette of his signature pose. These banners were in use for all of AFJ's social media platforms, as well as at the end of every email that was sent out from our email system, in order to promote the 2019 Hummingbird Gala.<br><br>Furthermore, I came up with preliminary designs for merchandise to be sold at the gala. Each design featured all three organizations that made this gala possible, accompanied by a hummingbird or the silhouette of Usain Bolt used on the social media banners.</p>
          <h3>Annual Report Booklet</h3>
          <p>This booklet serves as The AFJ’s annual report for potential investors who are considering donating to the communities in need in Jamaica. It is used to highlight the impact that the nonprofit organization made over the previous year and provide insight for the investors. Using the colors of the Jamaican Flag was considered at one point; however, I decided in the end that basing the palette around hues of blue would provide a more pleasurable reading experience for the viewers.</p>

          <h3>ECST Packaging</h3>
          <p>This packaging design was used for East Coast Surf Tribe merchandise which ranges from shirts to stickers. It incorporates the blue color scheme reminiscent of the logo, present in the center of the package design. At the bottom of the design, ECST’s slogan, “Souls to Seas,” is written in a script font that resonates with the waves of the ocean.</p>
          <h3>ECST Logo/Merchandise</h3>
          <p>The logo of East Coast Surf Tribe invokes what it strives to invoke in its practices. Free-flowing, clean waves of the ocean. The negative space found within the letters of “ECST” is reminiscent of designs found in surf culture, resonating with the target segment of this start-up company. A variant of the main logo with the full branding was also created.<br><br>A sticker design that initially started as a potential logo proved popular with beachgoers around the world. Hanging on cars and street signs everywhere from the United States to Australia, the circular shape provides a perfect shape to be used as a sticker.</p>

          <p>This brand’s logo is a semi-symmetric, geometric “S” shape encased in a border sharing the same gradient fill. This logo was designed to be able to elegantly spin as a 3D object, all while cleanly presenting itself in 2D. This logo also works in two-tone settings, which is vital for many situations in digital interfaces.<br><br>My first venture into AfterEffects served as an advertisement of sorts for this branding. The two main themes of this video was the use of lens flares and the use of diamond-shaped panels resembling the border of the logo.<br><br>A concept storyboard was also created for an alternative animation. In this concept, the logo would fold itself like an origami. This origami is actually foldable in real life using the steps listed above.</p>

          <h2>Premier League Visuals</h2>
          <h3>Chelsea Posters</h3>
          <p>I see this project as a timeline of my graphic design journey. Ever since my first interactions with digital creation tools, I made a tradition of making annual posters for various soccer teams. To showcase a little bit of my development, here are some of the posters for the team I support, Chelsea FC. All of these posters were created using some combination of Photoshop and Illustrator. Every year, I tried to implement new techniques I learned over the past year to improve upon the previous iteration.<br><br>This is the most recent version of the poster, which I turned more into an infographic over the previous iterations. By implementing panel designs prevalent in many modern UIs, I was able to present more information to provide a more in-depth view of the team.</p>
          <h3>Chelsea Photo Edits</h3>
          <p>A more recent project involves three photo edits of some Chelsea FC players. The first edit, featuring Kai Havertz, focused on removing background elements to highlight his status as “The Best.” The next edit features his German compatriot, Timo Werner. To visualize his speed, I removed his presence from the original image and incorporated two other images of the player to create an afterimages speeding away from the opponent. The final edit is dedicated to Christian Pulisic, who had a Man of the Match performance against the eventual champions Liverpool. By adding numerous defenders surrounding the American winger, the image conveys his trickery and agility.</p>
          <h3>Premier League Posters</h3>
          <p>Here are some of the other teams’ posters created over the years. The first two images of this section are covers for the collection of posters that I created for each season of the Premier League. Both of these covers were created using Piktochart.<br><br>While I chose to only showcase two teams from different seasons, each poster incorporated themes of the teams they are representing. The Arsenal poster was created using Illustrator while the Manchester City poster was created using Piktochart.</p>
          <h3>KFA Posters</h3>
          <p>Occasionally, I would venture outside club teams and make similar posters for the Korean National Team.<br><br>To celebrate the team announcement that decided which players will be representing my home country in the 2018 World Cup, I created a variety of graphics. The first design shown is a team roster much in line with the previous Premier League posters, with a metro style I familiarized myself with at the time. Each of the 23 players were also given two versions of player cards; Each variation’s design took inspiration from the two kits used at the tournament.</p>

          <h3>Lush Logo Redesign</h3>
          <p>This is a conceptual redesign of the cosmetic brand Lush’s logo. Currently, Lush is known for their stark black and white identity, which contrasts with their extremely colorful products. The most appealing part of their branding to me is this contrast, which I wanted to incorporate into the logo itself. Taking into account their belief for environmentally friendly products, I incorporated a set of leaves that contrast with the main part of the logo.<br><br>Here are some variants that can potentially be used. For example, the storefront can have LED signages that change the color of the leaves as needed. Perhaps, the colors can represent the season or the new products they are promoting at the time.</p>
          <h3>Number Logos</h3>
          <p>These two logos were created for personal use. They are based on two numbers that are deemed “lucky” in many cultures, especially those of the Eastern countries.<br><br>For lucky 7, I chose to create a geometric logo by overlapping elements of the numbers 2 and 9, just like how they can be arithmetically combined to create the number 7. This logo can be used negatively or in black & white schemes as well due to its clear cut silhouette.<br><br>The number 8's logo is based on two motifs. The first motif is a mobius strip, a one-sided plane with no end. However, to contrast this logo with the overused concept of combining the number 8 with a mobius strip, I also added the motif of a whip. This logo contrasts with the "7" logo, as the fluid, unending shape of the number 8 breaks away from the emerging trend of geometric logos, while being able to be used in a two-tone color scheme.</p>

        <p id='journey-text'>My venture into the world of graphic design actually started when my high school French teacher made an offhand comment about a website called Piktochart. Later that week I made an account and started messing around with the tools that they give you. Before I knew it, I spent 2 years making over 50 posters and infographics on my free time.<br><br>Upon entering college, I decided to take my interest in graphic design to the next level and started self-learning Photoshop and Illustrator. I’m sure all of us have been here before; there were moments where I would feel incredibly frustrated by my own lack of knowledge, yet filled with excitement knowing what I’ll be able to do in the future.<br><br>So just a bit more effort I put in. Within a few years I ended up making things I could not have imagined when I started, including works for the one and only Usain Bolt. I cannot wait to see what I will have created in a few more years.<p>
